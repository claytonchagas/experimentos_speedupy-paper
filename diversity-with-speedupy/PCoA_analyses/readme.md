## Notes/Todo

- loading pcoa into RMTstat - what am i analyzing?
- can I do pcoa on the full matrix on the cluster?
- figure out how to estimate loadings per chromosome



## Questions for 7-25-13 Meeting

How do i go from PCoA eigenvalues to RMT stat to find significant eigens?
How do I translate that into finding which CentCs group together?
Can we try to work with the big matrix to calculate PCoA eigens on that?
